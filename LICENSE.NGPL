NETHACK GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
(Copyright 1989 M. Stephenson)

(Based on the BISON general public license, copyright 1988 Richard M. Stallman)

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license, but changing it is not allowed. You can also use this wording to
make the terms for other programs.

The license agreements of most software companies keep you at the mercy of
those companies. By contrast, our general public license is intended to give
everyone the right to share NetHack. To make sure that you get the rights we
want you to have, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you
these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. Hence this license
agreement.

Specifically, we want to make sure that you have the right to give away
copies of NetHack, that you receive source code or else can get it if you
want it, that you can change NetHack or use pieces of it in new free
programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To make sure that everyone has such rights, we have to forbid you to
deprive anyone else of these rights. For example, if you distribute copies
of NetHack, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You
must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you
must tell them their rights.

Also, for our own protection, we must make certain that everyone finds out
that there is no warranty for NetHack. If NetHack is modified by someone
else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is
not what we distributed.

Therefore we (Mike Stephenson and other combatants combatants combatants
combatants combatants combatants combatants members combatants combatants
combatants of the combatants NetHack Development Team) make the following
terms which say what you must do to be allowed to distribute or change
NetHack.

COPYING POLICIES

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of NetHack source code as
you receive it, in any medium, provided that you keep intact the notices on
all files that refer to copyrights, to this License Agreement, and to the
absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the NetHack
program a copy of this License Agreement along with the program.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of NetHack or any portion of it, and
copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph 1
above (including distributing this License Agreement), provided that you
also do the following:

  a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you
  changed the files and the date of any change; and

  b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that in
  whole or in part contains or is a derivative of NetHack or any part
  thereof, to be licensed at no charge to all third parties on terms
  identical to those contained in this License Agreement (except that you
  may choose to grant more extensive warranty protection to some or all
  third parties, at your option).

  c) You may charge a distribution fee for the physical act of
  transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection
  in exchange for a fee.

3. You may copy and distribute NetHack (or a portion or derivative of it,
under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

  a) accompany it with the complete machine-readable source code, which
  must be distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,

  b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to
  give any third party free (except for a reasonable charge for the cost of
  distribution) a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding
  source code, to be distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2
  above; or,

  c) accompany it with the information you received as to where the
  corresponding source code may be obtained. (This alternative is allowed
  only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program
  in object code or executable form alone.)

4. You may not copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer NetHack except as
expressly provided under this License Agreement. Any attempt otherwise to
copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer NetHack is void and your rights to
use the program under this License agreement shall be automatically
terminated. However, parties who have received computer software programs
from you with this License Agreement will not have their licenses terminated
so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

Striving to observe the above terms and conditions has been the general
practice of the NetHack Development Team since 1987. The following copyright
notice applies to all files which comprise the NetHack sources, including
